            <h1> MY SELF TESTING WEBSITE </h1>
            <p> I created this site to showcase both my front end development and automated testing skillset. The site includes various features like old projects, an animated background, light/dark mode, and a responsive section for rating my skills, but these are really placeholders for the main purpose - a website that runs tests on itself!</p>
